	<h2 class="mt-4"> Qualifications </h2>
    <p class="lead">
	BSc Applied Computing, Northumbria University, 2017
	</p>
	<h2 class="mt-4">Profile</h2>
	<p>
	My interest in the IT industry initiated during my Computing course at University. I was part of many group projects where I was always learning about such as Java, HTML and PHP along with others. I also used many IDE systems such as BlueJ and Dreamweaver in order to complete assignments. The nature of my degree allowed me to become a very analytical-minded individual and made me very keen in pursuing a job in a technology-based environment.</br>
	During University, I decided that my leadership skills needed improvement, this lead me to my path of becoming a Manager at one of my local takeaway stores. During my time as Manager, I boosted team moral and increased productivity due to improved team building and proficient leadership skills. </br>
	After University, I decided to work in the computing field, specialising in the software aspect of technology as it allows me to implement my programming knowledge and learn further.

	<h2 class"mt-4">Experience</h2>
	<h3 class"mt-6">NB Gardens</h3> 
	<p>In this project, I assumed the role of team leader, delegating my team tasks and overviewing them to keep to time constraints while monitoring quality and efficiency.</br>
	Along with the team leader responsibilities, I collaborated on front-end design along with backend framework and one of the lead designers of the BPMN, along with this I helped to contribute with my team members on any of the other functionality.    </p>
	<h3 class"mt-6">Java SE- Library </h3> 
	<p>In this project I created a library with functionality to add new items, such as books, maps and journals to a system, and then developed a new class person to allow checked out books to be logged and if they were available or checked out and who by. <br/>
	Within this system, there was extra functionality which was added such as the ability to edit items and to edit people, beyond this there is an option to search for items by ID, which would allow a barcode scanner to be used to help check in and out items with ease. <br/>
	In this system I approached this with test driven development (TDD), this allowed me to test as I went and allowed me to find any errors that raised due to change of code. This allowed any problems to be handled quickly, and allowed for a well-rounded system. </p>
	<h3 class"mt-6">Movies API</h3> 
	<p>In this system we worked with queries using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), I created a database that persisted information. I had a backend using Java EE, this was completed with a basic front end that that displayed the information if the format I set. Within this I used a multi-tier architecture to develop the system. <br/></p>
	<p>I tested this system thoroughly, with TDD and further testing with the front end making sure the application was working fluently, I also adapted business rules where I had a list of banned movies, this would be checked against any new entity that would be added to the system.  </p>
